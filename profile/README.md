I am an experienced software developer with a passion for building efficient and scalable applications. My expertise lies in backend development, although I enjoy working across the full stack. I have a strong command of languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, with extensive knowledge of frameworks like Node.js, Express.js, and Django.

Over the years, I have collaborated on various projects in domains including e-commerce, finance, and health tech. I pride myself on clean code, robust architecture, and a keen sense for performance optimization. I believe in the Agile methodology and am well-versed in practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), which ensure high-quality deliverables.

When I undertake full-stack projects, I leverage technologies such as React for the frontend, and typically use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data management. I have a keen interest in cloud computing and have worked with AWS and Azure to enhance application scalability.

Apart from programming, I am continuously enhancing my skills through online courses and tech meetups, particularly on topics like machine learning and blockchain technology. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects that align with my interests, and one of my pinned repositories is a collaborative tool designed to streamline project management for agile teams.
